![Static Badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Solved-2%2F3219%20%3D%200.00062%25-brightgreen?style=for-the-badge)

## About

A collection of the leetcode problems I've done. I tried to include my thought process and the solution I came up with. This is a work in progress and I will be adding more problems as I do them.

I majorly used C++ for the solutions, but I also used Python and Java for some problems. I will try to include the solutions in all three languages.
